AI-Powered Task Optimizer - Emotion Detection Module

This project is part of the AI-Powered Task Optimizer designed to enhance productivity and well-being by analyzing real-time emotions through text-based sentiment analysis and facial emotion recognition.

üîç Overview

The Emotion Detection Module leverages advanced AI models to understand human emotions from two key sources:

1. Text to Emotion Recognition: Captures sentiments from written text to classify emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.


2. Facial Emotion Recognition: Analyzes facial expressions using RetinaFace for high-precision face detection, converting frames to RGB for enhanced accuracy. Emotions are detected with near real-time precision, covering primary emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutrality.
